Set up so bulk of SVG parse and write code is in PDF::Builder::SVG separate package.
Rest of stuff is normal image with optional use of PDF::Builder::SVG, which will in
turn prereq SVG::Parser et al., and BE FOR SALE. Someone not buying PBS will simply
have the dummy stubs in PDF::Builder, while someone installing PBS will get SVG
image support.


Builder.pm contains some SVG-specific that needs updating (image_svg s/b in
Page.pm)

Docs.pm similar

SVG.pm.SVG is older version of Strawberry's SVG.pm

SVG_SP.pm.SVG ?? eventually SVG.pm will be just dummy return and _SP will be
real one?

use Image::SVG::Path to decode "d" tag
use Image::SVG::Transform to decode the transform attribute
Desktop\SVG\svg\ contains a bunch of .svg files
